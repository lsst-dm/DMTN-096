\section{Introduction}

DM has been asked how we can save 10\% of its remaining cost ($\approx$ \$7M).
The official scope options which one might invoke are listed in \citeds{LPM-72}, but we have also identified some further possibilities which are described in this document.
This note also discusses the practical aspects of invoking these options.

We have identified three viable cost saving options in 2018, of which two are not in the currently baselined version of \citeds{LPM-72}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Eliminate portal aspect of science platform (DM-10; refer to \secref{sect:dm10}).
\item Reduce quality of data facility services provided to the construction project (DM15; refer to \secref{sect:dm15}).
\item Move staff from institutions to AURA posts (DM16; refer to \secref{sect:dm16}).
\end{itemize}

In addition there are other tasks which may be delayed, thus keeping them available as options which may be invoked later.
These are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Delay base center operation in Chile (keeps DM13 available, and saves money on operational costs).
\item Delay development of the mini broker.
\item Return some budget from DAX.
\end{itemize}

All of this will be rolled up in one or more LCRs in the not too distant future.
