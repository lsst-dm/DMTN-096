\section{Introduction}

DM have been  asked  how  we can save 10\% of remaining DM cost  ($\approx$ \$7M).
The official scope options which one might  invoke are in \citeds{LPM-72}, but there are other options.
Furthermore that does not really explain how this might be enacted hence this brief note.

 We have identified three viable cost saving options in 2018--- two were not in scope options document:
\begin{itemize}
\item Eliminate portal aspect of science platform (DM-10) \secref{sect:dm10}.
\item Reduce quality of data facility services provided to the construction project (DM15)\secref{sect:dm10}.
\item Move staff from institutions to AURA posts (DM16) \secref{sect:dm16}.
\end{itemize}

In addition there are other tasks which may be delayed thus keeping them as options for later namely:

\begin{itemize}
\item Delay base center operation in Chile (keeps DM13 available plus once we start it cost money to run it).
\item Delay development of the mini broker.
\item Return some budget from DAX.
\end{itemize}

All of this will be rolled up in one or more LCRs in the not to distant future.
