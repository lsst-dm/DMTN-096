\section { Overview of requirements affected by DM-10}\label{sect:reqs}
\citeds{LDM-554} enumerates science platform requirements the labels used here are from that document and are the requirements affected by the scope option.
\citeds{DMTR-52} is a test report on the platform.

 {\bf Note:} There are no SUI/Firefly needs for commissioning.
\begin{itemize}
\item  DMS-LSP-REQ-0008, DMS-PRTL-REQ-0004 Semantic linkage - logical links between data shown in portal (ok)
\begin{itemize}
\item Have this but its going to have to evolve with the data .. more work for users if we do not do it
\end{itemize}

\item  DMS-LSP-REQ-0010 Transfer between portal and notebook (ok)
\item  User Storage - implication of UI for DMS-LSP-REQ-0011 to 18 - some of this is done.
\item  Portal aspect
\begin{itemize}
\item  DMS-PRTL-REQ-0001 Browser access (ok)
\item DMS-PRTL-REQ-0002 Discovery (ok)
\item DMS-PRTL-REQ-0005,6 Calibration and Coadd and Single Epoch access (ok)
\item DMS-PRTL-REQ-0007 access to other VO services (On the list of things to do in ramp down)
\end{itemize}

\item Query support
\begin{itemize}
\item  DMS-PRTL-REQ-0009 to 38, Async Queries, Spatial, Id etc.
\begin{itemize}
\item Mainly backend but need some interface - some done
\item other possibilities exist, EPO will have to do many of these as well
\end{itemize}
\item DMS-PRTL-REQ-0040 to 46 - visualize based in images meta data (ok)
\end{itemize}


\item Alert and tabular data
\begin{itemize}
\item DMS-PRTL-REQ-0048 to 54 - showing alerts and tabular data
\begin{itemize}
\item mostly done - also others tools exist (e.g. Topcat)
\end{itemize}
\item DMS-PRTL-REQ-0055 to 74 - Graphing, scatter plots, histograms, uncertainties etc ..
\begin{itemize}
\item Arguably we {\em should NOT } provide this in the portal
\item notebooks and other tools are already better for this.
\item We should look  more critically at requirements like this.
\end{itemize}
\item DMS-PRTL-REQ-0075 to 77 - image overlay and color adjustment (ok)
\begin{itemize}
\item  Need in portal questionable  (most scientists will use their own tools )
\item There are other tools that do this like Visiomatic.
\end{itemize}


\item All Sky  DMS-PRTL-REQ-0078 to 88 (ok)
\begin{itemize}
\item  There are also other tools (Aladin lite) - may not be as nicely integrated
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\item Exploration and Analysis DMS-PRTL-REQ-0089 to 108
\begin{itemize}
\item  Many nice to have things like table filtering, selection from plots, linked plots
\item Again questionable we {\em need} this in the portal and there are other tools.
\end{itemize}

\item Control and Management DMS-PRTL-REQ-0115 to 118 (some of this is implemented)
\begin{itemize}
\item  Preferences, API , quotas ..
\end{itemize}
\item Alert support DMS-PRTL-REQ-0119 to 21,27
\begin{itemize}
\item This is not done - mainly since the alert mini broker is not done
\item Worst case the simple interface coming with the mini broker is used  and not well integrated.
\end{itemize}

\item Documentation DMS-PRTL-REQ-0122 to 24
\begin{itemize}
\item  Can claim this with \url{www.lsst.io}
\item This may not perhaps be  as tightly integrated as may be liked.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
