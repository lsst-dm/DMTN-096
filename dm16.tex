\section{DM16 Reduce LDF service level}\label{sect:dm16}

NCSA has been  asked to do an impact analysis of a reduction in budget by 20\%. This
can only be achieved by reducing the staffing level from 20FTE to 16.
This may result in a lower service level for DM development it probably has no impact on science except in the realm of reliability.
We continue to find it difficult to track effort and deliverables from NCSA this also needs to improve with better milestones.

The cloud  maystill yield further savings.
We are in discussion with Google on cloud deployments - assessing the actual cost of this relative to ownership of machines at NCSA is difficult.
    See  \citeds{DMTN-072} for a rough cost comparison with cloud services.


A 20\% reduction in NCSA costs for the remaining four years of construction is worth about \$3.5M.
