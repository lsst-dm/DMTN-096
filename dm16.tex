\section{DM16: Reduce LDF service level}\label{sect:dm16}

NCSA has been  asked to do an impact analysis of a reduction in budget by 20\%.
This can only be achieved by reducing the staffing level from 20 FTE to 16.
This may result in a lower service level for DM development it probably has no impact on science except in the realm of reliability.
Note that we continue to find it difficult to track effort and deliverables from NCSA; this urgently needs to improve.

Adopting a ``cloud computing'' based approach may yield further savings.
We are currently prototyping cloud-based deployments of DM systems in conjunction with Google.
Assessing the actual cost of this relative to physical hardware at NCSA is difficult; see \citeds{DMTN-072} for a rough comparison.

A 20\% reduction in NCSA costs for the remaining four years of construction is worth about \$3.5M.
