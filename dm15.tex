If we could identify perhaps ten  individuals who would move to AURA posts thus eliminating institutional overheads we could save potentially  \$100k per individual or \$1M per year. It will take months to put this in place of course so we would not get three years of savings.

this is a scientifically and  functionally painless way to trim the budget. It can cause some disruption for the individuals concerned.

 Potential saving of \$2M  or more to end of construction.
